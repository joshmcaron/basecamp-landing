    <h1>Basecamp OS</h1>
    <p><strong>The intelligent training system for serious mountain athletes.</strong></p>
    <p>Basecamp OS is built by someone who lives the alpine training life. It’s not just another fitness app — it’s a personal, adaptive performance system for anyone training toward Denali, Everest, UTMB, and other summit-level goals.</p>
    <p>Whether you're running, strength training, or using a hypoxic system, Basecamp adapts daily based on your effort, time, and gear. It includes an AI trainer, workout fallback logic, recovery sliders, and a goal-specific UI.</p>
    <p>The app is currently available for Android through the Google Play Store. iOS support is planned.</p>
    <p><em>From Denali to the Himalayas — this is your basecamp.</em></p>
